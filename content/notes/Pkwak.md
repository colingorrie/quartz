**Pkwak** is a [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat language]] spoken on the northern coast of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]].

## History

Pkwak emerged out of a cluster of Sakrat B languages spoken by migrants to the north coast of Continent A between 1000â€“500 BP, where they gradually displaced the [[Pre-Pkwak]] languages previously spoken in that region. This process was only complete by 300 BP. As a result of this gradual displacement, there was extensive substrate influence of the Pre-Pkwak languages on Pkwak.

## Dialects

There are four major dialects of Pkwak: 

- Dialect S
- Dialect M
- Dialect 

These dialects are often divergent grammatically, not only due to contributions in different proportions of the founding Sakrat B varieties, but also due to influence from different Pre-Pkwak substrate languages.

Later, a Koine Pkwak, which combined features from the different dialects, emerged as a standard in the Pkwak-speaking regions.
