**Agriculture** emerged in at least three distinct places: these are the known as the "cradles of civilization". One was the southwestern corner of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]], one was the northernmost point of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]], and the third was the southern portion of [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]].

## Continent D Cradle of Civilization

On the slopes of the mountains in the south of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]] the [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]] speakers begin cultivating the root crops their hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. In terraces down the slopes of the mountain [[Nab]] is grown where there is an abundance of water as it tolerates even total submergence. Where it is drier, [[Ranik]] is grown. Fruit trees are propagated and stands of [[Dleg]] are planted. [[Pukak]], [[Dja|dja]] and [[Nrog|nrog]] are kept as livestock in pens and [[Kes|kes]] and [[Rabad|rabad]] are caught in the water.

Creating an abundance of food [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat]]-speaking peoples are able to spread across their home continent and across the islands and even onto [[notes/Continent C|continents C]], [[notes/Continent A|A]] and, eventually, [[notes/Continent E|E]].
