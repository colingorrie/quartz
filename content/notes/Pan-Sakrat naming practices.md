Names in the [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat languages]] are almost always composed of exactly two morphemes. These bimorphemic names are interpreted as compounds of various types. For example, the name of the Sakrat culture hero [[Dwan Tarun]] is a verb-noun compound meaning _Fruit-holder_ (lit. _hold fruit_), while the name **\*pukak tap** _many chicken_ is a [Bahuvrihi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahuvrihi) compound meaning _One who has many chickens_.

This custom is present in all cultures where Sakrat languages are spoken and can therefore be reconstructed back to [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]].

Here is a table of some example names in Proto-Sakrat and [[notes/Pkwak\|Pkwak]]:
