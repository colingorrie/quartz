The **Sakrat languages** are a major language family.

## History

### To 1500 BP

The ancestor of the Sakrat languages, [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]], was spoken around 2300 BP in the southern tip of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]].

After the Proto-Sakrat period the Sakrat languages divided into 3 groups, conventionally called Sakrat A, Sakrat B, and Sakrat C.

The speakers of Proto-Sakrat B expanded along the savannah on the west coast of Continent D, forming a distinct linguistic group by 1900 BP.

The speakers of Proto-Sakrat A migrated from Continent D to the southern volcanic isles between Continent D and [[notes/Continent C|Continent C]]. This migration was complete by approximately 1600 BP.

Proto-Sakrat C speakers expanded along the eastern edge of the mountains which line the southern coast of Continent D and then and up the rainforested east coast, where they emerged as a distict linguistic group around the year 1500 BP.

### 1500–1000 BP

The speakers of Proto-Sakrat B split into two linguistic groups: one that migrated over the sea to the southeastern peninsula of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] (Proto-Sakrat B2), and the other which remained on the west coast of Continent D (Proto-Mris-Lassjut). This separation was complete by the year 1300 BP.

Little is known about the development of the Sakrat A branch during this period, although presumably the languages diverged in the island chain between continents C and D.

The Sakrat C branch diverged into Sakrat C1, whose speakers continued migrating north along the eastern coast of Continent D until they reached the northern peninsula, and Sakrat C2, whose speakers remained in the southern coastal highlands.

### 1000–500 BP

The speakers of Sakrat B2 languages spread up the eastern coast of continent A coming into contact with and displacing the eastern [[Pre-Pkwak]] societies already there.

Meanwhile, Proto-Mris-Lassjut speakers crossed the sea to Continent C. This caused a split between the Continent D branch (the Mris languages) and the Continent C branch (the Lassjut languages), which was complete by 900 BP.

Around 700 BP, the Sakrat C1 language [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]] is differentiated in the northern peninsula of Continent D.

### 500–0 BP

The displacement of the Pre-Pkwak speakers of the northern peninsula of Continent A continued until the entire region was speaking a variety of Sakrat B2 called Pkwak. This process was complete by 300 BP.

Around 400 BP, speakers of Kra Nzlor sailed to [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]] where they came to exert strong cultural influence on speakers of [[notes/Lenethailef|Lenethailef]] (the [[notes/Tarunian exchange|Tarunian exchange]]).
