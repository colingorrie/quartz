## Phonology

### Consonants

|             | Labial | Coronal | Palatal | Velar |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| Stop        | p b    | t d     | k g     |       |
| Nasal       | m      | n       |         |       |
| Affricate   |        | dz      |         |       |
| Fricative   |        | s       |         |       |
| Flap        |        | ɾ \<r\> |         |       |
| Approximant |        |         | j       | w     |

### Vowels

|      | Front       | Central     | Back        |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| High | i iː \<ii\> |             | u uː \<uu\> |
| Low  |             | a aː \<aa\> |             |

Phonetically, the vowels are usually produced more centrally than the phonemic chart indicates, i.e. /i/ = \[ɪ\], /u/ = \[ʊ\], /a/ = \[ɐ\]. This is true of both long and short vowels, e.g. /iː/ = \[ɪː\].

There are also two diphthongs: /ai/ and /au/. Phonetically, these too are more centralized than their phonological representation might suggest: /ai/ = \[ɐɪ\], /au/ = \[ɐʊ\].

### Syllable Structure

Null onsets are possible in Biirai. If an onset is present, it consists of a single consonant or a stop + /ɾ/ cluster.

Biirai syllables are minimally bimoraic. This means that all syllables must contain either (a) a long vowel or diphthong, or (b) a coda consonant.

Coda consonants are drawn from a restricted set: /w j ɾ m n p t k/.

With these constraints in mind, we can characterize the maximal syllable in Biirai as: (C)(ɾ)V(C).

### Stress

Stress in Biirai is root-initial.
