title: "Biiraiverse Fanfiction Contest"
---

To celebrate the 50th livestream on our channel,[^1] we'd like to give the talented members of our community an opportunity to have a more active hand in shaping the lore of the Biiraiverse. To that end, we're holding a **Biiraiverse Fanfiction Contest**!

[^1]: Albeit somewhat belatedly: [stream #50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1TRSfSF75s) aired on August 16, 2022.

The winner will have their submission **canonized** as part of the history of the Biiraiverse. Additionally, we'll produce a video in which Colin will narrate the story, and excerpts from the story will be used as translation prompts for future conlanging.

The winner will be chosen based on a community vote of all eligible entries.

Here's the prompt:

> The year is 200BP (before present). A group of merchants from the coastal [[notes/Pkwak|Pkwak]]-speaking regions of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] make a voyage into the inland desert to obtain valuable goods to sell in their homeland. But the desert is [[notes/Biirai (language)|Biirai]] land, and the travellers have a lot to learn. Adventure ensures.
