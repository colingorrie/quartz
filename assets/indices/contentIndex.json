    "title": "Biiraiverse Fanfiction Contest",
    "content": "\nTo celebrate the 50th livestream on our channel,[^1] we'd like to give the talented members of our community an opportunity to have a more active hand in shaping the lore of the Biiraiverse. To that end, we're holding a **Biiraiverse Fanfiction Contest**!\n\n[^1]: Albeit somewhat belatedly: [stream #50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1TRSfSF75s) aired on August 16, 2022.\n\nThe winner will have their submission **canonized** as part of the history of the Biiraiverse. Additionally, we'll produce a video in which Colin will narrate the story, and excerpts from the story will be used as translation prompts for future conlanging.\n\nThe winner will be chosen based on a community vote of all eligible entries.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n\u003e The year is 200BP (before present). A group of merchants from the coastal [[notes/Pkwak|Pkwak]]-speaking regions of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] make a voyage into the inland desert to obtain valuable goods to sell in their homeland. But the desert is [[notes/Biirai (language)|Biirai]] land, and the travellers have a lot to learn. Adventure ensures.\n\nFeel free to ask any worldbuilding clarification questions in the `#biiraiverse` channel in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/chCmQgE99a).\n\n## Logistics\n\nHere are the details\n\n- Maximum length: **1000 words**.\n- Deadline for submission: **October 4, 2022, 2:00pm Eastern time**.\n- Content: Keep it suitable for all ages to comply with Youtube guidelines.\n- Submission: Post the file to the `#fanfiction` channel in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/chCmQgE99a).\n- Licence: You agree to release the text under the Creative Commons licence [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) (as is all Biiraiverse material).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\u003e [!FAQ] How can we name the Pkwak-speaking characters?\n\u003e\n\u003e For help in naming characters, consult the [[notes/Pan-Sakrat naming practices|Pan-Sakrat naming practices]] page.\n\n\u003e [!FAQ] Can we coin Biirai words and put them in a glossary at the bottom for when we use them for proper nouns and such?\n\u003e \n\u003e Yes, that's a great idea!\n\n\u003e [!FAQ] Since the contest page mentions that some passages may be translated in a livestream, could we write it all in English and then use font color to indicate what language the dialogues should be spoken in?\n\u003e \n\u003e Another great idea!\n\n\u003e [!FAQ] Would going over 1000 words disqualify an entry?\n\u003e\n\u003e If you go a bit over 1000, it's no big deal. If it's substantially over, we'll just take a 1000 word subsection and record it if it wins.\n\n\u003e [!FAQ] What kinds of transport would there be from the Pkwak region to the Biirai region? What form would the merchants likely use?\n\u003e \n\u003e There's the possibility of river travel at least part of the way since we haven't sketched out rivers yet and there very well could be some.\n\u003e \n\u003e Native to [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] are two animals that may be of interest:\n\u003e - Pre-Pkwak [[notes/Qaña|*qaɲa]] \"A mammal which gives wool and milk like an alpaca\"\n\u003e - Pre-Pkwak [[notes/Xangi|*xaŋi]] \"A large mammal used as a beast of burden like a camel.\"\n\u003e  \n\u003e By this point in history, they'd also have access to an animal from [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]]:\n\u003e - Pre-Qal [[notes/nduly|*nɗɯʎ]] \"a mammal used as a beast of burden like a horse.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Agriculture",
    "content": "\n**Agriculture** emerged in at least three distinct places: these are the known as the \"cradles of civilization\". One was the southwestern corner of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]], one was the northernmost point of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]], and the third was the southern portion of [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]].\n\n## Continent A Cradle of Civilization\n\nThe second site is at the northern tip of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] where there is both a mediterranean and a subtropical climate. The group of cultures who inhabited this region are collectively called the [[Pre-Pkwak]], although they can be divided into two main groups. The western Pre-Pkwak peoples spread to the southwest along the mediterranean coast and along the hot steppe coast where they grow [[Tsatsu]] and other hardy crops. The eastern Pre-Pkwak peoples spread southest along the savanna coast. During this time the early [[notes/Biirai (people)]] culture emerges and trades goods from the desert with the Pre-Pkwak. The Biirai adopt some of the Pre-Pkwak agricultural practices and begin to grow [[Usuli]] and [[Tsatsu]] at their oases in the desert.\n\n### Staple starchy foods\n\n- [[Faɲi]] - A grain which can grow in water like rice. \n- [[Suɲau]] - A high yield grain like wheat. \n- [[Tsatsu]] - A lower yield but hardier grain like millet.\n\n### Protein\n\n- [[Hapa]] - A waterfowl like a duck.\n- [[notes/Qaña|Qaña]] - A mammal which gives wool and milk like an alpaca.\n- [[Xaŋi]] - A large mammal used as a beast of burden like a camel.\n- [[Cari]] - A small legume like a lentil. \n- [[Muqa]] - A legume which grows underground like a peanut. \n\n### Veggies\n\n- [[Ruci]] - a leafy vegetable like lettuce.\n- [[Xuqa]] - a long thin root vegetable like a carrot.\n- [[Jaŋu]] - a thick bulbous root like swede. \n- [[Timihu]] - a vegetable with an edible stalk like asparagus.\n\n### Fruit\n\n- [[Usuli]] - Fruit of a palm tree like dates.\n- [[Wita]] - a fruit like pomegranate. \n- [[Katsa]] - a fruit like figs.\n- [[Mati]] - a fruit like apricots. \n- [[Wimixu]] - a fruit like peaches.\n- [[ʃana]] - a fruit like a plum.\n- [[ɲica]] - a fruit like cherries.\n\n## Continent D Cradle of Civilization\n\nOn the slopes of the mountains in the south of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]] the [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]] speakers begin cultivating the root crops their hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. In terraces down the slopes of the mountain [[Nab]] is grown where there is an abundance of water as it tolerates even total submergence. Where it is drier, [[Ranik]] is grown. Fruit trees are propagated and stands of [[Dleg]] are planted. [[Pukak]], [[Dja|dja]] and [[Nrog|nrog]] are kept as livestock in pens and [[Kes|kes]] and [[Rabad|rabad]] are caught in the water.\n\nCreating an abundance of food [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat]]-speaking peoples are able to spread across their home continent and across the islands and even onto [[notes/Continent C|continents C]], [[notes/Continent A|A]] and, eventually, [[notes/Continent E|E]].\n\n### Staple starchy foods\n\n- [[Ranik]] - A starchy root like sweet potato.\n- [[Nab]] - A starchy root like taro.   \n- [[Lared]] - A starchy tree fruit like a plantain.\n- [[Tukar]] - A starchy tree fruit like breadfruit.\n- [[Sib]] - The starchy pith of a palm tree like sago.\n- [[Dleg]] - A grass with a thick edible core like sugarcane.  \n\n### Protein\n\n- [[Pukak]] - A jungle bird like a chicken.\n- [[Kes]] - Fish of various kinds.\n- [[Dja]] - A rodent like the polynesian rat.\n- [[Nrog]] - A mammal eaten for meat like a pig. It looks like a little hippo because reasons.             \n- [[Rabad]] - A range of seafood such as clams, crabs and shrimp etc.\n- [[Sruŋ]] - A legume like a chickpea. \n\n### Vegetables\n\n- [[Basos]] - A leafy vegetable with many forms. Like cabbage, broccoli etc.\n- [[Taw]] - A fruit of a vining plant like squash and pumpkins.  \n- [[Nabos]] - A root vegetable with edible leaves like swede or beetroot. \n\n### Fruits\n\n- [[Dud]] - A hard tree fruit like a coconut. \n- [[Daswi]] - A sour tree fruit like a lemon. \n- [[Pwan]] - A juicy tree fruit like an orange. \n- [[Tarun ???]] (Yellow Fruit) - A tree fruit like a banana.\n- [[Danid]] - A round tree fruit like a mango. \n- [[Tarun ninja]] (Black Fruit) - A fruit with black skin and soft flesh like an avocado. \n- [[Lep]] - Weird fruit 1 – A fruit a little larger than a mango divided into sections (usually 8-10), Each section has its own peel something like the skin of an orange although the fruit is a pale green all over. The individual segments once removed from the skin have a soft flesh a bit like a peach and each has a central seed. Picture a fruit made of several small peaches wrapped in orange skin.\n- [[Tarun swi]] (Seed fruit) - Weird fruit 2 – A fruit with a thick rind surrounding a white creamy fruit filled with small seeds. The fruit is edible and nutritious but very bland tasting. The seeds when roasted taste delicious hence the name. Picture a sort of white avocado filled with little seeds.\n- [[Ragum]] - Weird fruit 3 – Red fruit with spiny outer casing. Its flesh is chewy and sweet but tart. It has small seeds in the center.\n- [[Sedil]] - Weird fruit 4 – Savoury palm berries. Bright red berries with a slightly sweet but mostly kinda savoury taste. Imagine a red currant but with a taste like a well cooked chickpea.\n",

    "content": "\n**Biirai** is a [[notes/Biiraic languages|Biiraic language]].\n\n## Phonology\n\n### Consonants\n\n|             | Labial | Coronal | Palatal | Velar |\n| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- |\n| Stop        | p b    | t d     | k g     |       |\n| Nasal       | m      | n       |         |       |\n| Affricate   |        | dz      |         |       |\n| Fricative   |        | s       |         |       |\n| Flap        |        | ɾ \\\u003cr\\\u003e |         |       |\n| Approximant |        |         | j       | w     |\n\n### Vowels\n\n|      | Front       | Central     | Back        |\n| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| High | i iː \\\u003cii\\\u003e |             | u uː \\\u003cuu\\\u003e |\n| Low  |             | a aː \\\u003caa\\\u003e |             |\n\nPhonetically, the vowels are usually produced more centrally than the phonemic chart indicates, i.e. /i/ = \\[ɪ\\], /u/ = \\[ʊ\\], /a/ = \\[ɐ\\]. This is true of both long and short vowels, e.g. /iː/ = \\[ɪː\\].\n\nThere are also two diphthongs: /ai/ and /au/. Phonetically, these too are more centralized than their phonological representation might suggest: /ai/ = \\[ɐɪ\\], /au/ = \\[ɐʊ\\].\n\n### Syllable Structure\n\nNull onsets are possible in Biirai. If an onset is present, it consists of a single consonant or a stop + /ɾ/ cluster.\n\nBiirai syllables are minimally bimoraic. This means that all syllables must contain either (a) a long vowel or diphthong, or (b) a coda consonant.\n\nCoda consonants are drawn from a restricted set: /w j ɾ m n p t k/.\n\nWith these constraints in mind, we can characterize the maximal syllable in Biirai as: (C)(ɾ)V(C).\n\n### Stress\n\nStress in Biirai is root-initial.\n\n## Morphology\n\n### Valency and argument structure\n\nEach Biirai root has an intrinsic and inflexible argument structure. To use a root in a different argument structure configuration, explicit morphology is reguired. For example, the root **siitim** _move_ can only be used intransitively; to introduce a direct object, the suffixed form **siitim-an** _move (something)_ must be used.\n\n\u003e[!EXAMPLE]\n\u003e Use of the transitivizing suffix **-an**  \n\u003e \n\u003e **minkii-siitim=nau**  \n\u003e `hand-move=1NEUT`  \n\u003e _My hand moves (lit. I hand-move)._  \n\u003e \n\u003e **minkii-siitim-an=nau duu**  \n\u003e `hand-move-TR=1NEUT 3D`  \n\u003e _I move it (with my hand) (lit. I hand-move it)._  \n\nSimilarly, to use intrinsically transitive roots intransitively, detransitivizing morphology is required. For example, the root **biirai** _await_ requires a direct object; only the suffixed form **biirai-t** _wait_ can be used intransitively.\n\n\u003e[!EXAMPLE]\n\u003e Use of the detransitivizing suffix **-(i)t**  \n\u003e \n\u003e **biirai=bai bii rai biirai**  \n\u003e `await=2HUM DEF ten stars`  \n\u003e _You await the ten stars._  \n\u003e \n\u003e **biirai-t=bai**  \n\u003e `await-DETR=2HUM`  \n\u003e _You wait._\n\nThere is a handful of these valency-adjusting suffixes associated with dfferent argument structures, and the restrictions on the co-occurrence of these suffixes with various classes of roots is a topic of interest in Biirai morphosyntax.\n",

During this period, Lenethailef coexisted alongside [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]], and the contact between the two gave rise to the creole [[notes/Selal Sela|Selal Sela]].\n\nMajor linguistic changes during this period:\n\n- extensive regularization of nominal and verbal morphology\n\n### Modern Lenethailef\n\nThe Modern Lenethailef period begins in approximately 200 BP. During this period, the direct influence of [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]] has abated, but the Kra Nzlor-lexified creole [[notes/Selal Sela|Selal Sela]] remains spoken as a basilectal variety alongside Lenethailef.\n",

For example, the name of the Sakrat culture hero [[Dwan Tarun]] is a verb-noun compound meaning _Fruit-holder_ (lit. _hold fruit_), while the name **\\*pukak tap** _many chicken_ is a [Bahuvrihi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahuvrihi) compound meaning _One who has many chickens_.\n\nThis custom is present in all cultures where Sakrat languages are spoken and can therefore be reconstructed back to [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]].\n\nHere is a table of some example names in Proto-Sakrat and [[notes/Pkwak\\|Pkwak]]:\n\n| Proto-Sakrat  | Gloss           | Translation                 | Pkwak       |\n| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |\n| \\*dwan tarun  | hold fruit      | fruit-holder                | dwan trun   |\n| \\*pukak tap   | chicken many    | (one of) many chickens      | pkwak tap   |\n| \\*ruban ŋisun | sail storm      | sailor-into-the-storm       | abwan ŋsjun |\n| \\*kal kes     | spirit fish     | fish spirit                 | kaw kes     |\n| \\*lupit re    | flower sun      | sunflower                   | opwit re    |\n| \\*ljap sakam  | accept bless    | blessing-accepter           | ljap skʰam  |\n| \\*ra ljaw     | come.from water | one who comes from water    | ra ljaw     |\n| \\*sre ljaw    | go.to water     | one who goes into the water | ʂe ljaw     | \n",

    "content": "\nThe **Sakrat languages** are a major language family.\n\n## History\n\n### To 1500 BP\n\nThe ancestor of the Sakrat languages, [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]], was spoken around 2300 BP in the southern tip of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]].\n\nAfter the Proto-Sakrat period the Sakrat languages divided into 3 groups, conventionally called Sakrat A, Sakrat B, and Sakrat C.\n\nThe speakers of Proto-Sakrat B expanded along the savannah on the west coast of Continent D, forming a distinct linguistic group by 1900 BP.\n\nThe speakers of Proto-Sakrat A migrated from Continent D to the southern volcanic isles between Continent D and [[notes/Continent C|Continent C]]. This migration was complete by approximately 1600 BP.\n\nProto-Sakrat C speakers expanded along the eastern edge of the mountains which line the southern coast of Continent D and then and up the rainforested east coast, where they emerged as a distict linguistic group around the year 1500 BP.\n\n### 1500–1000 BP\n\nThe speakers of Proto-Sakrat B split into two linguistic groups: one that migrated over the sea to the southeastern peninsula of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]] (Proto-Sakrat B2), and the other which remained on the west coast of Continent D (Proto-Mris-Lassjut). This separation was complete by the year 1300 BP.\n\nLittle is known about the development of the Sakrat A branch during this period, although presumably the languages diverged in the island chain between continents C and D.\n\nThe Sakrat C branch diverged into Sakrat C1, whose speakers continued migrating north along the eastern coast of Continent D until they reached the northern peninsula, and Sakrat C2, whose speakers remained in the southern coastal highlands.\n\n### 1000–500 BP\n\nThe speakers of Sakrat B2 languages spread up the eastern coast of continent A coming into contact with and displacing the eastern [[Pre-Pkwak]] societies already there.\n\nMeanwhile, Proto-Mris-Lassjut speakers crossed the sea to Continent C. This caused a split between the Continent D branch (the Mris languages) and the Continent C branch (the Lassjut languages), which was complete by 900 BP.\n\nAround 700 BP, the Sakrat C1 language [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]] is differentiated in the northern peninsula of Continent D.\n\n### 500–0 BP\n\nThe displacement of the Pre-Pkwak speakers of the northern peninsula of Continent A continued until the entire region was speaking a variety of Sakrat B2 called Pkwak. This process was complete by 300 BP.\n\nAround 400 BP, speakers of Kra Nzlor sailed to [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]] where they came to exert strong cultural influence on speakers of [[notes/Lenethailef|Lenethailef]] (the [[notes/Tarunian exchange|Tarunian exchange]]).\n",
