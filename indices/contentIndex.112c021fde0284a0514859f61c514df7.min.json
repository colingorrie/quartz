It emerged as a distinct language around 1100 BP.\n\n## History\n\n### Old Lenethailef\n\nThe Old Lenethailef period lasted between approximately 1100 and 800 BP.\n\nAn example of Old Lenethailef poetry can be found in the following poem, which is a translation of the [[notes/My«ênh|My«ênh]] poem [[notes/When you cross the river|When you cross the river]].\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE]\n\u003e When you cross the river\n\u003e \n\u003e **Mith enechl-athes temen-√´ich**,  \n\u003e `you cross-COND1 river-ACC`  \n\u003e _When you cross the river,_  \n\u003e \n\u003e **Mi lunu-c-√´ich kus chan suth.**  \n\u003e `Myinh-GEN bless-NMLZ-ACC never now receive.NEG`  \n\u003e _No more will you receive the blessings of Myinh._\n\u003e \n\u003e **Fuchech eluth hel-ish;**  \n\u003e `chicken alas devour-PRESUM`  \n\u003e _Chickens, alas, will devour you;_\n\u003e \n\u003e **susu-c-√´ich nef-ish sef-√ò math-√ò.**  \n\u003e `feel-ing-ACC distant-PRESUM heart-GEN pain-GEN`  \n\u003e _it will be far from the feeling of my heart's pain._\n\n### Low Middle Lenethailef\n\nThe High Middle Lenethailef period lasted between approximately 800 to 600 BP.\n\nMajor linguistic changes during this period:\n\n- regularization of nouns/verbs begins\n- sound changes:\n\t- loss of /x/ and voiced allophone […£]\n\t\t- …£ =\u003e √ò (w/ compensatory lengthening)\n\t\t- x =\u003e √ß / [-back] _\n\t\t- √ß =\u003e j\n\t- unrounding of front rounded vowels\n\n### High Middle Lenethailef\n\nThe High Middle Lenethailef period lasted between approximately 600 to 400 BP.\n\nMajor linguistic changes during this period:\n\n- regularization of nouns/verbs continues\n- influenced by [[notes/Justamija Qal|Justamija Qal]], with widespread borrowing\n- SOV tendencies\n- **-(i)ja** genitive\n\n### Early Modern Lenethailef\n\nThe Early Modern Lenethailef period lasted from approximately 400 to 200 BP. During this period, Lenethailef coexisted alongside [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]], and the contact between the two gave rise to the creole [[notes/Selal Sela|Selal Sela]].\n\nMajor linguistic changes during this period:\n\n- extensive regularization of nominal and verbal morphology\n\n### Modern Lenethailef\n\nThe Modern Lenethailef period begins in approximately 200 BP. During this period, the direct influence of [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]] has abated, but the Kra Nzlor-lexified creole [[notes/Selal Sela|Selal Sela]] remains spoken as a basilectal variety alongside Lenethailef.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/My%C7%90nh":{"title":"My«ênh","content":"\n**My«ênh** is a [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat language]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pkwak":{"title":"Pkwak","content":"\n**Pkwak** is a [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat language]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Qal-languages":{"title":"Qal Languages","content":"\nThe **Qal languages** are a major language family spoken on the west coast of [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]] and the southeastern coast of [[notes/Continent B|Continent B]].\n\n## Phylogeny\n\nThere are three main subdivisions within the Qal languages:\n\n- Qal 1, which includes [[notes/Justamija Qal|Justamija Qal]].\n- Qal 2, which is hitherto undescribed.\n- Qal 3, which includes [[notes/Lenethailef|Lenethailef]] and a second language, hitherto undescribed.","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Sakrat-languages":{"title":"Sakrat languages","content":"\nThe **Sakrat languages** are a major language family.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Sasyut":{"title":"Sasyut","content":"\n**Sasyut** is a [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat language]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Selal-Sela":{"title":"Selal Sela","content":"\n**Selal Sela** is a creole language formed out of the contact between speakers of [[notes/Kra Nzlor|Kra Nzlor]] and [[notes/Lenethailef|Lenethailef]].\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/Sotonic":{"title":"Sotonic","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null},"/notes/When-you-cross-the-river":{"title":"When you cross the river","content":"\n**When you cross the river** is a poem, originally written in [[notes/My«ênh|My«ênh]], but later translated to many other languages, including [[notes/Lenethailef|Lenethailef]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T17:57:50.156168988Z","tags":null}}
