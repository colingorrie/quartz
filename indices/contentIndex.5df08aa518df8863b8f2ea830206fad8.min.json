One was the southwestern corner of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]], one was the northernmost point of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]], and the third was the southern portion of [[notes/Continent E|Continent E]].\n\n## Continent D Cradle of Civilization\n\nOn the slopes of the mountains in the south of [[notes/Continent D|Continent D]] the [[notes/Proto-Sakrat|Proto-Sakrat]] speakers begin cultivating the root crops their hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. In terraces down the slopes of the mountain [[Nab]] is grown where there is an abundance of water as it tolerates even total submergence. Where it is drier, [[Ranik]] is grown. Fruit trees are propagated and stands of [[Dleg]] are planted. [[Pukak]], [[Dja|dja]] and [[Nrog|nrog]] are kept as livestock in pens and [[Kes|kes]] and [[Rabad|rabad]] are caught in the water.\n\nCreating an abundance of food [[notes/Sakrat languages|Sakrat]]-speaking peoples are able to spread across their home continent and across the islands and even onto [[notes/Continent C|continents C]], [[notes/Continent A|A]] and, eventually, [[notes/Continent E|E]].\n\n### Staple starchy foods\n\n- [[Ranik]] - A starchy root like sweet potato.\n- [[Nab]] - A starchy root like taro.¬† ¬†\n- [[Lared]] - A starchy tree fruit like a plantain.\n- [[Tukar]] - A starchy tree fruit like breadfruit.\n- [[Sib]] - The starchy pith of a palm tree like sago.\n- [[Dleg]] - A grass with a thick edible core like sugarcane.¬† \n\n### Protein\n\n- [[Pukak]] - A jungle bird like a chicken.\n- [[Kes]] - Fish of various kinds.\n- [[Dja]] - A rodent like the polynesian rat.\n- [[Nrog]] - A mammal eaten for meat like a pig. It looks like a little hippo because reasons. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† \n- [[Rabad]] - A range of seafood such as clams, crabs and shrimp etc.\n- [[Sru≈ã]] - A legume like a chickpea. \n\n### Vegetables\n\n- [[Basos]] - A leafy vegetable with many forms. Like cabbage, broccoli etc.\n- [[Taw]] - A fruit of a vining plant like squash and pumpkins.¬†¬†\n- [[Nabos]] - A root vegetable with edible leaves like swede or beetroot.¬†\n\n### Fruits\n\n- [[Dud]] - A hard tree fruit like a coconut. \n- [[Daswi]] - A sour tree fruit like a lemon. \n- [[Pwan]] - A juicy tree fruit like an orange. \n- [[Tarun ???]] (Yellow Fruit) - A tree fruit like a banana.\n- [[Danid]] - A round tree fruit like a mango. \n- [[Tarun ninja]] (Black Fruit) - A fruit with black skin and soft flesh like an avocado.¬†\n- [[Lep]] - Weird fruit 1 ‚Äì A fruit a little larger than a mango divided into sections (usually 8-10), Each section has its own peel something like the skin of an orange although the fruit is a pale green all over. The individual segments once removed from the skin have a soft flesh a bit like a peach and each has a central seed. Picture a fruit made of several small peaches wrapped in orange skin.\n- [[Tarun swi]] (Seed fruit) - Weird fruit 2 ‚Äì A fruit with a thick rind surrounding a white creamy fruit filled with small seeds. The fruit is edible and nutritious but very bland tasting. The seeds when roasted taste delicious hence the name. Picture a sort of white avocado filled with little seeds.\n- [[Ragum]] - Weird fruit 3 ‚Äì Red fruit with spiny outer casing. Its flesh is chewy and sweet but tart. It has small seeds in the center.\n- [[Sedil]] - Weird fruit 4 ‚Äì Savoury palm berries. Bright red berries with a slightly sweet but mostly kinda savoury taste. Imagine a red currant but with a taste like a well cooked chickpea.\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T17:38:07.351332042Z","tags":null},"/notes/Biirai-language":{"title":"Biirai (language)","content":"\n**Biirai** is a [[notes/Biiraic languages|Biiraic language]].\n\n## Phonology\n\n### Consonants\n\n|             | Labial | Coronal | Palatal | Velar |\n| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----- |\n| Stop        | p b    | t d     | k g     |       |\n| Nasal       | m      | n       |         |       |\n| Affricate   |        | dz      |         |       |\n| Fricative   |        | s       |         |       |\n| Flap        |        | …æ \\\u003cr\\\u003e |         |       |\n| Approximant |        |         | j       | w     |\n\n### Vowels\n\n|      | Front       | Central     | Back        |\n| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| High | i iÀê \\\u003cii\\\u003e |             | u uÀê \\\u003cuu\\\u003e |\n| Low  |             | a aÀê \\\u003caa\\\u003e |             |\n\nPhonetically, the vowels are usually produced more centrally than the phonemic chart indicates, i.e. /i/ = \\[…™\\], /u/ = \\[ ä\\], /a/ = \\[…ê\\]. This is true of both long and short vowels, e.g. /iÀê/ = \\[…™Àê\\].\n\nThere are also two diphthongs: /ai/ and /au/. Phonetically, these too are more centralized than their phonological representation might suggest: /ai/ = \\[…ê…™\\], /ai/ = \\[…ê ä\\].\n\n### Syllable Structure\n\nNull onsets are possible in Biirai. If an onset is present, it consists of a single consonant or a stop + /…æ/ cluster.\n\nBiirai syllables are minimally bimoraic. This means that all syllables must contain either (a) a long vowel or diphthong, or (b) a coda consonant.\n\nCoda consonants are drawn from a restricted set: /w j …æ m n p t k/.\n\nWith these constraints in mind, we can characterize the maximal syllable in Biirai as: (C)(…æ)V(C).\n\n### Stress\n\nStress in Biirai is root-initial.","lastmodified":"2022-08-23T17:38:07.351332042Z","tags":null},"/notes/Biiraic-languages":{"title":"Biiraic languages","content":"\nThe **Biiraic languages** are a family of languages spoken in the interior desert of [[notes/Continent A|Continent A]].
